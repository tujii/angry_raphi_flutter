# angry_raphi

A new Flutter project.

## Setup

### API Keys

To use the Gemini AI features, you'll need to obtain a Gemini API key from Google AI Studio:
- Get your API key at: https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys
- Create a file named `gemini_api_key` in the project root directory
- Add your API key to this file (the file is already included in `.gitignore` for security)

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
